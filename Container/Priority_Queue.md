priority_queue is just like a normal queue except the element removed from the queue is always the greatest among all the elements in the queue, thus this container is usually used to replicate Max Heap in C++. Elements can be inserted at any order and it have O(log(n)) time complexity for insertion.

Following is the syntax for creating a priority queue:

priority_queue<int> pq;
